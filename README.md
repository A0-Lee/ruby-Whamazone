Ruby - 2.7.0
Rails - 5.2.4.4

*See Gemfile for detailed versions of manually chosen and installed ruby gems


Author Notes:
-----------------------------------------
Any documentation and concerns or issues related to the project are addressed here in this file (e.g. copyright issues, design and code issues etc.).


Database Schema and Migrations:
-----------------------------------------
Rails uses a Model/Migration system to handle database tables and fields using sqlite3. I will be using sqlite3 for my development and test databases.
Note: The database development.sqlite3 is used by the rails server whereas test.sqlite3 is used by rails or rake test.


Testing and Development:
-----------------------------------------
I will be testing this Rails application under the latest released version of Ubuntu Linux 64-bit (using VMware on Windows 10) along with the latest version of the Chrome browser at the time and date of submission.
